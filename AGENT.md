Below is the current goals...

User Experience & Interface
Enhanced Controls

Add preset telescope configurations (beginner refractor, advanced Dobsonian, etc.) for quick starting points
Implement undo/redo functionality for design changes
Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
Include tooltips explaining optical parameters (what focal ratio means, etc.)

Better Visualization

Add a side-by-side comparison mode to compare different designs
Include a 3D preview option using Three.js alongside the 2D SVG
Add measurement annotations showing key dimensions
Implement zoom and pan controls for the preview area

Technical Features
Advanced Optical Calculations

Calculate and display key metrics like focal ratio (f/ratio), field of view, magnification limits
Add eyepiece selection with calculated magnifications
Include light-gathering power comparisons
Show theoretical resolution limits

Export & Sharing

Export to multiple formats (PNG, PDF, DXF for laser cutting)
Generate parts lists with dimensions
Add sharing functionality with unique URLs for designs
Export telescope specifications as a downloadable report

Educational Enhancement
Learning Features

Add an "Explain" mode that describes how changing parameters affects performance
Include ray diagram overlays showing light paths
Add beginner tutorials or guided design workflows
Include links to relevant astronomical concepts

Code Quality & Architecture
Technical Improvements

Implement proper state management (Redux or Zustand)
Add TypeScript for better type safety
Create modular component architecture
Add unit tests for optical calculations
Implement proper error handling and validation

Performance

Optimize SVG rendering for complex designs
Add progressive loading for heavy computations
Implement design caching for faster iterations

Additional Features
Extended Functionality

Add support for more telescope types (Schmidt-Cassegrain, Maksutov, etc.)
Include mount modeling with balance point calculations
Add finder scope positioning and sizing options
Implement cost estimation based on mirror/lens sizes

Collaboration

Add user accounts and design saving
Implement design sharing and commenting
Create a gallery of community designs
